# FreddieGrayBaltimoreTweets
Some analysis I did on Baltimore tweets during the Freddie Gray protests and riots in Baltimore in 2015

It includes the baltimore arrests data from baltimore's open data. Also includes some tweets from Baltimore taken during the height of the protests.

Baltimore.ipyn is the IPython Notebook with most of the cool stuff.

getgeo.py is a script I wrote to grab baltimore tweets from the public API
